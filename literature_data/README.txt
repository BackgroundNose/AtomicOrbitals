The k99l and k00heavy directories contain the tabulated Hartree-Fock
wave functions for Z=1-54 and Z=55-103, respectively, which I received
from Ajit Thakkar. The citations for the data are given in HFwfn.bib,
which you should cite if you use the library.

For completeness, the file also contains a citation to a review
article on analytical Hartree-Fock wave functions.
